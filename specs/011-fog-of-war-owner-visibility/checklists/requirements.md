# Specification Quality Checklist: Fog of War Owner Visibility

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Small, focused expansion of existing fog-of-war masking (troop count only
  → owner + troop count); the visibility-set definition itself is unchanged.
- Independent of features 008-010, 012-014. Explicitly does not touch
  spectator visibility, which belongs to the separate online-multiplayer
  landing-page/matchmaking feature (005).
- All checklist items pass on first pass.
